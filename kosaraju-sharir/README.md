# Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm implementation in C++

- Performs two complete traversals of the graph
- If the graph is represented as an adjacency list, then the algorithm runs in Theta(|V|+|E|) time (linear)
- If the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, then the algorithm runs in Big-O(|V|^2) time
